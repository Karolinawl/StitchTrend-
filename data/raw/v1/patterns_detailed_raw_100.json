          "about_me": "Zanete Hussain is a former software developer turned knitwear designer, challenging her creative limits and inspiring others to do the same. Zanete's journey as a knitter started innocently enough, like many impassioned knitters. But soon, she realized that knitting was much more than a hobby.\r\n\r\nFor years, Zanete juggled her love for arts and crafts–from needlework to playing the piano–with a successful career in the tech industry as a programmer and software architect. But, four years ago, during maternity leave for her second child, the pull of knitting was too strong to resist. She taught herself everything she could about the craft, pouring over YouTube tutorials and Instagram feeds to learn new yarns, needles, and techniques. As she knitted sweaters and cardigans, knitting became a way to express her creativity, rest her emotions, and find peace amidst the chaos of everyday life.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't long before Zanete's friends and a growing community of followers on social media started to take notice of her intricate designs and beautiful garments. \r\n\r\nParticularly, Zanete had one friend from college who always asked her to explain how she knitted garments she posted online. Eventually, she realized everyone was looking for practical guidance, so she taught herself how to create knitting patterns to help express her process in a way knitters understood best. After three months of learning how to create patterns and guides on knitting, Zanete launched Zanete Knits to inspire other knitters who want to create beautiful garments and feel more fulfilled as craftspeople.\r\nWithin a few years, Zanete's patterns gained a following of over thirty thousand people. \r\n\r\nToday, Zanete is a recognized influencer in knitwear design. She is known for her innovative use of traditional motifs from Latvian folklore in modern colourwork garments and her ability to push the limits of what is possible with various yarns. She has been featured in numerous knitting magazines, and her patterns have been used by knitters everywhere. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can find her on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and TikTok as @zaneteknits. \r\n\r\nJoin Zanete Knits mailing list and be the first to know about test calls, new pattern releases, exclusive discounts, events and other news: https://go.zaneteknits.com/news \r\n",

With the chunky version I’d like to achieve bigger stripes and a faster knit :) Because I love it so much and to easily find the back side when putting it on I stitched a little heart on the back collar :heart:</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>For any questions please join the <a href=\"https://www.ravelry.com/discuss/ankestrick-designs/4271389/1-25\">knitting support</a> in the ANKESTRiCK group</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The BABA sweater Chunky is worked seamlessly from the top down in 2x2 stripe pattern (2 rounds - 2 colors) throughout. Start working the collar and then increase for yoke. Then the yoke is worked with raglan increases to sleeve separation.

There are options for 2 different necklines.\r\nWorked with 2 strands of DK yarn to achieve the final look. \r\n\r\nYou will find useful links to YouTube videos that I used when making this sweater.\r\n\r\nSKILL LEVEL - you will need to know how to knit, purl and seam (useful links provided)\r\n\r\nSIZES include XS/S, M/L, XL/XXL\r\nChoose your size based on your preferred fit:\r\n· XS/S – finished chest circumference 104cm, body length 65cm\r\n· M/L – finished chest circumference 112cm, body length 65cm\r\n· XL/XXL- finished chest circumference 138cm, body length 65cm\r\n\r\nNEEDLES AND CABLES\r\n8mm (US 11) and 6mm (US 10) circular needles\r\n56cm and 35 cm cable (length before attaching needles)\r\nTapestry needles\r\nstitch markers\r\nYARN\r\n   - Emotions by James C.

    "notes_html": "\n<p>Cloud Sweater is worked from the top down. First the back yoke is worked back and forth while short rows are worked to shape the shoulders. Then each shoulder is worked separately, back and forth and with short rows. The shoulders are then joined to form the front yoke. The front and back yoke are joined at the underarms to form the body, which is worked in the round on a circular needle. The sleeves are worked from stitches that are picked up and knitted along the armhole openings. The sleeves are worked in the round. At the end, the stockinette stitch funnel neckline is worked from stitches that are picked up and knitted along the neck opening.</p>\n\n<p>Knit a swatch before beginning the project to check if the recommended needle size gives you the correct gauge.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size guide</strong> <br />Cloud Sweater is designed to have approx. 25 cm [9¾ inches] of positive ease in the smaller sizes and then gradually less positive ease in the larger sizes. The sizes XXS (XS) S (M) L (XL) 2XL (3XL) 4XL (5XL) are designed to fit a bust circumference of 75-80 (80-85) 85-90 (90-95) 95-100 (100-110) 110-120 (120-130) 130-140 (140-150) cm [29½-31½ (31½-33½) 33½-35½ (35½-37½) 37½-39½ (39½-43¼) 43¼-47¼ (47¼-51¼) 51¼-55 (55-59) inches].</p>\n\n<p>The measurements for the finished sweater are listed on the front page of the pattern.

    "notes": "Cloud Sweater is worked from the top down. First the back yoke is worked back and forth while short rows are worked to shape the shoulders. Then each shoulder is worked separately, back and forth and with short rows. The shoulders are then joined to form the front yoke. The front and back yoke are joined at the underarms to form the body, which is worked in the round on a circular needle. The sleeves are worked from stitches that are picked up and knitted along the armhole openings. The sleeves are worked in the round. At the end, the stockinette stitch funnel neckline is worked from stitches that are picked up and knitted along the neck opening.\r\n\r\nKnit a swatch before beginning the project to check if the recommended needle size gives you the correct gauge.\r\n\r\n**Size guide**\r\nCloud Sweater is designed to have approx. 25 cm \\[9¾ inches\\] of positive ease in the smaller sizes and then gradually less positive ease in the larger sizes.

When the back part has reached the same length as the front parts, all parts are joined under the armpits. The sweater is now worked back and forth in rows with cut-outs along the front parts.

Feb. 2022</strong>: Ranunculus includes now 11 sizes, size 3 is same as before, sizes 1 &amp; 2 are smaller size, sizes 4–11 are larger size. <strong>Spanish pattern</strong> on 13. Apr. 2022 &amp; <strong>French pattern</strong> on 09. May. 2022. If you have purchased this pattern before update, please update your pattern in your Ravelry Library (click “my notebook“ at the upper right, scroll down to ”Library“, then click “update“ bellow this pattern), then you can download new version.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ranunculus is a top-down round yoke pullover with lace and textured stitches. I have designed yoke pattern to look like wearing layers of necklace. I have knitted short rows between neckribbing and yoke pattern not only on back bit also on front, so that neckline has a bit boat neck shape and yoke pattern has necklace look. The round yoke has ample depth and finished pullover has cropped length so that you can lay it over dresses or high-waisted skirts and pants. If crops aren’t your style, please adjust body to your favorite length.</p>\n\n<p>You can choose from smaller or wider neckline, <br />and short sleeves or long puff sleeves with/without diagonal cuff line.</p>\n\n<p>You can use lace, light fingering to worsted weight yarn. The degree of transparency depends on the weight of yarn. Knitting with thin yarn on big needle gives light, transparent and airy texture to this pullover.

Feb. 2022**: Ranunculus includes now 11 sizes, size 3 is same as before, sizes 1 & 2 are smaller size, sizes 4–11 are larger size. **Spanish pattern** on 13. Apr. 2022 & **French pattern** on 09. May. 2022. If you have purchased this pattern before update, please update your pattern in your Ravelry Library (click “my notebook“ at the upper right, scroll down to ”Library“, then click “update“ bellow this pattern), then you can download new version.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRanunculus is a top-down round yoke pullover with lace and textured stitches. I have designed yoke pattern to look like wearing layers of necklace. I have knitted short rows between neckribbing and yoke pattern not only on back bit also on front, so that neckline has a bit boat neck shape and yoke pattern has necklace  look. The round yoke has ample depth and finished pullover has cropped length so that you can lay it over dresses or high-waisted skirts and pants. If crops aren’t your style, please adjust body to your favorite length.\r\n\r\nYou can choose from smaller or wider neckline, \r\nand short sleeves or long puff sleeves with/without diagonal cuff line.\r\n\r\nYou can use lace, light fingering to worsted weight yarn. The degree of transparency depends on the weight of yarn. Knitting with thin yarn on big needle gives light, transparent and airy texture to this pullover. Using thicker yarn or holding two yarns together adds more weight, and more structured look.\r\n\r\nI hope you can enjoy  knitting!\r\n\r\n> **Sizes** \r\n> \r\n> 1 (2, 3, 4)(5, 6, 7)(8, 9, 10, 11)\r\n> \r\n> Finished bust circumference: 117 (123,\r\n> 129, 134) (140, 146, 151)(157, 166,\r\n> 174, 180) cm / 46 (48.5, 50.75,\r\n> 52.75)(55, 57.5, 59.5)(61.75, 65.25, 68.5, 70.75)”\r\n> \r\n> **Yarn** \r\n> \r\n> You can use lace, light fingering to\r\n> worsted  weight yarn.\r\n> \r\n> **long sleeve:**  520 (530, 560, 600)(620, 680, 710)(780, 820, 850,\r\n> 860) m  / 569 (580, 612, 656)(678,\r\n> 744, 776)(853, 897, 930, 941) yds. \r\n> \r\n> \r\n> **Short sleeve:**  370(390, 400, 440)(470, 510, 540)(590, 620, 650,\r\n> 660) m / 405(427, 437, 481)(514, 558,\r\n> 591)(645, 678, 711, 722) yds. \r\n> \r\n> **Needles**\r\n> \r\n> 6 mm [US 10] circular needle as main\r\n> needle. 5 mm [US 8] needle for hem\r\n> ribbing and finishing sleeve.

          "about_me": "Behind My Favourite Things you'll meet Louise. \r\nLouise has been working in the Danish fashion industry for more than a decade, and has been taking part in developing and growing well-known designer brands for years.  \r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning of MFTK, Louise's main focus has been to create classic and timeless wardrobe favourites of high quality, that lasts for more than a season: simple but aesthetically pleasing designs with thought out details, always aiming for 'the perfect fit'. \r\n\r\nLouise says; 'After more than a decade in the fashion industry, I experienced a saturation of overconsumption and mass production. I felt a need to go back to my roots, crafting my wardrobe with my own hands.\r\nI was frustrated to see how collections became outdated almost before they hit the stores, and wanted to create something more long-lasting. \r\nThis is how the idea of MFTK came to life.\r\nI've taken the advantage of my many years of experience within fashion and design and created a brand of timeless knitwear without an expiry date.'\r\n\r\nAt MFTK you'll find knitting patterns at all different stages of difficulty.

I felt a need to go back to my roots, crafting my wardrobe with my own hands. <br />I was frustrated to see how collections became outdated almost before they hit the stores, and wanted to create something more long-lasting. <br />This is how the idea of MFTK came to life. <br />I’ve taken the advantage of my many years of experience within fashion and design and created a brand of timeless knitwear without an expiry date.’</p>\n\n<p>At MFTK you’ll find knitting patterns at all different stages of difficulty.

    "notes": "Sweater No. 29 is a loose fit, cabled sweater.\r\n\r\nIt is a classic style with focus on details. The pronounced saddle shoulders, combined with the use of short rows and neckline increases, contribute to an excellent and flattering fit.\r\n\r\nThe sleeves feature a slight flare that tapers towards the cuffs.\r\n\r\nThe sweater is worked from the top down with no seaming required.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSIZES\r\n\r\nXS (S) M (L) XL (2XL) 3XL (4XL)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMEASUREMENTS\r\n\r\nLength, center back: 48 (48) 51 (51) 54 (54) 57 (57) cm [19 (19) 20 (20) 21.25 (21.25) 22.5 (33.5) inches]\r\n\r\nCircumference: 99 (108) 117 (126) 135 (144) 153 (162) cm [39 (42.5) 46 (49.5) 53.25 (56.75) 60.25 (63.75) inches]\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSize guide\r\n\r\nSweater No. 29 has an oversized fit. Calculate a positive ease of approx. 20-25 cm [8-9.75 inches],\r\n\r\nThe sizes are equivalent to the European standard sizes 34/XS (36/S) 38/M (40/L) 42/XL (44/2XL) 46/3XL (48/4XL) and suit a chest measurement of approx. 80-85 (85-90) 90-95 (95-100) 100-110 (110-120) 120-130 (130-140) cm [31.5-33.5 (33.5-35.5) 35.5-37.5 (37.5-39.5) 39.5-43.5 (43.5-47.25) inches].\r\n\r\nFor example: You measure 87 cm [34.25 inches] at your widest + 20-25 cm [8-9.75 inches] = 107-112 cm [42-44 inches]. Meaning that you would choose a size S with a finished circumference of 108 cm [42.5 inches].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSUGGESTED NEEDLES\r\n\r\n5 mm [US 8] circular needles (80 or 100 cm [32 or 40 inches])\r\n\r\n4 mm [US 6] circular needles (80 or 100 cm [32 or 40 inches])\r\n\r\n3,5 mm [US 4] circular needles (40 or 80 cm [16 or 32 inches])\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGAUGE\r\n\r\nIn textured cable pattern using 5 mm [US 8] needles.\r\n\r\n20 sts / 26 rows = 10 x 10 cm [4 x 4 inches]\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMATERIALS\r\n\r\nWork the sweater holding two strands of yarn together.

          "about_me": "I was born in Switzerland on a cold day in November 1973. I moved to Denmark with my mother and brother in 1986. My father still lives in that wonderful country, Switzerland.\r\nI got my master’s degree in 1996 from Copenhagen Business School in ‘Design & Communication’ and have worked with digital solutions since that day.\r\nI have two twin girls, and a dog, and live with my boyfriend and his two children north of Copenhagen.\r\nHave run long-distance races most of my life, completed 10 marathons, and 2 Ironman, and been to Mount Everest BaseCamp. All this while I was working so much that I have unfortunately been affected by stress on several occasions.\r\nBut what does this have to do with knitting? Quite a lot actually. Because in addition to my two beautiful girls saying to me one day in the summer of 2019; ‘You can’t be a real grandma if you can’t knit’\r\nIt was also a way into a new world where I could find the joy of immersing myself in something completely different from digital solutions and a battle to count the number of kilometers I have run. Today, I don’t count ‘kilometres’ anymore, but how many stitches I have knitted!\r\nThe fact that I have learned to run means that I can still enjoy the forest and the dog several times a week - but now with a completely different peace and enjoyment.

          "about_me_html": "\n<p>I was born in Switzerland on a cold day in November 1973. I moved to Denmark with my mother and brother in 1986. My father still lives in that wonderful country, Switzerland. <br />I got my master’s degree in 1996 from Copenhagen Business School in ‘Design &amp; Communication’ and have worked with digital solutions since that day. <br />I have two twin girls, and a dog, and live with my boyfriend and his two children north of Copenhagen. <br />Have run long-distance races most of my life, completed 10 marathons, and 2 Ironman, and been to Mount Everest BaseCamp. All this while I was working so much that I have unfortunately been affected by stress on several occasions. <br />But what does this have to do with knitting? Quite a lot actually. Because in addition to my two beautiful girls saying to me one day in the summer of 2019; ‘You can’t be a real grandma if you can’t knit’ <br />It was also a way into a new world where I could find the joy of immersing myself in something completely different from digital solutions and a battle to count the number of kilometers I have run. Today, I don’t count ‘kilometres’ anymore, but how many stitches I have knitted! <br />The fact that I have learned to run means that I can still enjoy the forest and the dog several times a week - but now with a completely different peace and enjoyment. Exactly like when I fall in love with <br />some new yarn, dream about the pattern, count stitches in an excel sheet and on the needle. And when I follow the skilled test knitters who work diligently on my knitting patterns. <br />My stress and the wonderful announcement from my girls meant that in August 2019 I chose to start learning to knit! It started with my mother teaching me to cast on stitches and I knitted my first sweater <br />for my daughter. <br />It has now become my great pleasure to design knitting patterns and explore all the different types of yarn. <br />Since the beginning of 2020, I design and sell my own knitting patterns. <br />And in August 2023 I resigned my job after 19 years working at the same company. <br />That means that I’m now a full-time-self-employeed knitting desinger!</p>\n\n<p>I have published the book: Strik i struktur (in danish) and Struktur strick (in german).</p>\n",

Each shoulder is then worked back and forth on a circular needle, and then the shoulders are joined to form the front yoke. The front and back yoke are joined at the underarms to form the body, which is worked in the round on a circular needle with stripes.

    "notes_html": "\n<p><em>I found the spark for this design in an Oregon thrift shop while visiting my friend Jamie. Tucked among racks of threadbare t-shirts and well-worn flannel shirts was a chunky weight vintage sweater that combined brioche, garter stitch, and ribbing in an unusually beautiful way. I passed it up­—but couldn’t stop thinking about it. When I got home, I began experimenting with those textures myself, seeking that same balance of boldness and elegance.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The result is the Sunstone Pullover—a sweater that feels both grounded and luminous, cozy yet refined. Its raglan construction and inter-connecting brioche lines create a fabric that’s full of depth and movement.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong> <br /><strong>Design:</strong> The Sunstone Pullover is a boxy raglan sweater that blends texture and shape for bold visual impact. The front and back body are worked in plush brioche, with strategic yoke decreases forming elegant diagonal lines that converge into a striking center-front “V.” The deep yoke adds drama and balance to the silhouette, while the sleeves feature traditional tapered shaping in chunky garter stitch to echo the dimensionality of the brioche. A close-fitting neckband, along with 2x2 ribbing at the hem and cuffs, finishes the design with a polished, modern edge.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Construction:</strong> This sweater is knit seamlessly from the top down in the round. Stitches are cast on at the top of the neckband, which is worked first. Short rows shape the back neck for a comfortable fit. Once the yoke is complete, sleeve stitches are placed on hold while the body is knit. The sleeves are then returned to the needles and finished in the round.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fit:</strong> This garment is designed to be worn with 4 to 10 in. (10 to 20 cm) of positive ease in the body. To determine your ideal size, begin by measuring your upper bust (just under the arms, above the full bust). Then add your desired amount of ease and select the size with a finished chest circumference closest to that total. If you are new to choosing a garment size based on your upper bust, One Wild Designs has an excellent <a href=\"https://onewilddesigns.com/blogs/articles/using-the-upper-chest-measurement-to-choose-your-sweater-size\">blog post</a> that walks you through the process.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you find yourself between sizes, I recommend choosing your size based on the upper arm circumference.</strong> Because the shoulders and sleeves are more tailored compared to the body, choosing your size based the sleeve fit will ensure you maintain the intended silhouette without feeling like the arms are too tight!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Yarn:</strong> The yarn estimates provided in this pattern are approximations, calculated to allow for both a sizable swatch and the sweater, with a small margin of error.

    "notes": "*I found the spark for this design in an Oregon thrift shop while visiting my friend Jamie. Tucked among racks of threadbare t-shirts and well-worn flannel shirts was a chunky weight vintage sweater that combined brioche, garter stitch, and ribbing in an unusually beautiful way. I passed it up­—but couldn’t stop thinking about it. When I got home, I began experimenting with those textures myself, seeking that same balance of boldness and elegance.*\r\n\r\n*The result is the Sunstone Pullover—a sweater that feels both grounded and luminous, cozy yet refined. Its raglan construction and inter-connecting brioche lines create a fabric that’s full of depth and movement.*\r\n\r\n**NOTES**\r\n**Design:** The Sunstone Pullover is a boxy raglan sweater that blends texture and shape for bold visual impact. The front and back body are worked in plush brioche, with strategic yoke decreases forming elegant diagonal lines that converge into a striking center-front “V.” The deep yoke adds drama and balance to the silhouette, while the sleeves feature traditional tapered shaping in chunky garter stitch to echo the dimensionality of the brioche. A close-fitting neckband, along with 2x2 ribbing at the hem and cuffs, finishes the design with a polished, modern edge.\r\n\r\n**Construction:** This sweater is knit seamlessly from the top down in the round. Stitches are cast on at the top of the neckband, which is worked first. Short rows shape the back neck for a comfortable fit. Once the yoke is complete, sleeve stitches are placed on hold while the body is knit. The sleeves are then returned to the needles and finished in the round.\r\n\r\n**Fit:** This garment is designed to be worn with 4 to 10 in. (10 to 20 cm) of positive ease in the body.  To determine your ideal size, begin by measuring your upper bust (just under the arms, above the full bust). Then add your desired amount of ease and select the size with a finished chest circumference closest to that total. If you are new to choosing a garment size based on your upper bust, One Wild Designs has an excellent [blog post][2] that walks you through the process.\r\n\r\n**If you find yourself between sizes, I recommend choosing your size based on the upper arm circumference.** Because the shoulders and sleeves are more tailored compared to the body, choosing your size based the sleeve fit will ensure you maintain the intended silhouette without feeling like the arms are too tight!\r\n\r\n**Yarn:** The yarn estimates provided in this pattern are approximations, calculated to allow for both a sizable swatch and the sweater, with a small margin of error. Your actual yarn usage may vary based on factors such as your personal gauge, the yarn’s characteristics (e.g., fiber content, ply, thickness), and any modifications you make to the pattern.\r\n\r\n**SIZES**\r\n(1, 2, 3)(4, 5, 6)(7, 8, 9)\r\n[#sizeinclusive][3]\r\n\r\n**FINISHED MEASUREMENTS**\r\n**Finished Chest Circumference**\r\n(38.75, 42.75, 48)(52, 57.25, 61.25)(66.75, 70.75, 76) in.\r\n(97, 107, 120)(130, 143, 153)(167, 177, 190) cm\r\n\r\n**Finished Upper Arm Circumference**\r\n(12, 13.25, 14.25)(15, 16.5, 18.25)(19.5, 21.25, 22.75) in.\r\n(30, 33, 35.5)(37.5, 41.5, 45.5)(49, 53, 57) cm\r\n\r\n*This sweater is designed to be worn 4 to 10 in.

In this combination, both yarns create a balanced, harmonious fabric, and the knitting flows smoothly.\r\n\r\nIf you have little experience working with different yarn weights or prefer a more straightforward approach, you can alternatively knit the sweater using one strand of Järbo 3TR in both colors, or substitute yarns of comparable weight.\r\n\r\n**Note**\r\nIf you decide to knit the sweater a little longer, I recommend adding extra yarn.\r\n\r\n**Notions**\r\nStitch markers, stitch holders or scrap yarn, tapestry needle\r\n\r\n**Languages**\r\nEnglish, German\r\n\r\n\r\nDEUTSCHE VERSION\r\n\r\n**Preis**\r\nAbhängig vom Wohnsitzland kann zusätzlich die lokale Mehrwertsteuer (z. B. 19 % in Deutschland) enthalten sein. Diese Steuer wird von Ravelry gemäß den gesetzlichen Vorgaben erhoben und abgeführt.\r\n\r\n**Beschreibung**\r\nDer Rustic Stripe Sweater beginnt mit einem Rollkragen. Anschließend werden verkürzte Reihen gearbeitet, die gleichzeitig mit den Raglan-Zunahmen die Form der Passe gestalten.\r\nNach der Ärmelabtrennung wird der Körper in Runden bis knapp über die Taille gestrickt, wo ein klassisches 1 re / 1 li-Bündchen den Saum abschließt. Die Ärmel haben eine leichte Ballonform.\r\n\r\nDer gesamte Pullover wird im Streifenmuster gearbeitet, was ihm seinen charakteristisch rustikalen Ausdruck verleiht.\r\n\r\n**Größen**\r\nGeeignet für folgenden Brustumfang\r\n(Körpermaße, nicht das fertige Kleidungsstück):\r\n\r\nXS ca. 78–82 cm\r\nS ca. 88–92 cm\r\nM ca. 98–102 cm\r\nL ca. 108–112 cm\r\nXL ca. 118–122 cm\r\n\r\nLiegt dein Maß zwischen zwei Größen, wähle die kleinere für einen körpernäheren Sitz oder die größere für mehr Bewegungsfreiheit.\r\n\r\n**Techniken**\r\nFarbwechsel\r\nVerkürzte Reihen\r\nZunahmen\r\nStricken in Runden\r\n\r\n**Materialien**\r\nJärbo Svensk Ull 3TR (einfach gehalten)\r\nFarbe: Plum Plum\r\n\r\nXS 200 g – S 200 g – M 200 g – L 300 g – XL 300 g\r\n\r\nJärbo Svensk Ull 2TR (doppelt gehalten im gesamten Pullover)\r\nFarbe: Marbacka Pink\r\n\r\nXS 300 g – S 300 g – M 300 g – L 300 g – XL 300 g\r\n\r\nDer Rustic Stripe Sweater wird mit einem Faden Järbo 3TR und zwei Fäden Järbo 2TR gestrickt. Da Järbo 2TR feiner ist, wird es doppelt gehalten. In dieser Kombination entsteht eine ausgewogene Maschenstruktur, und das Stricken funktioniert problemlos.\r\n\r\nWenn du wenig Erfahrung mit unterschiedlichen Garnstärken hast oder es möglichst unkompliziert halten möchtest, kannst du alternativ mit einem Faden Järbo 3TR in beiden Farben oder mit Garnen vergleichbarer Stärke arbeiten. Achte in jedem Fall darauf, die Maschenprobe zu erreichen.\r\n\r\n**Hinweis**\r\nWenn du den Pullover etwas länger stricken möchtest, empfehle ich, zusätzlich Garn einzuplanen.\r\n\r\n**Zubehör**\r\nMaschenmarkierer, Maschenhalter oder Restgarn, Wollnadel\r\n\r\n**Sprachen**\r\nEnglisch, Deutsch",

I really did grow up in a ‘handmade home’ with little crocheted curtains above the windows made by my mother and grandmother (very popular in The Netherlands in the 1970’s), there were crocheted pot holders in the kitchen, my cardigans and jumpers were knitted, school dresses sewn and toys crocheted! \r\nSo it was a natural progression for me to be a crafty person into adulthood. Crocheting professionally started when I began writing my crochet blog ‘Coastal Crochet’ in 2015 www.coastalcrochet.com and I also enrolled on the International Diploma in Crochet course. As a result my crochet skills are varied and diverse.\r\nI have had many designs published in all the main UK crochet magazines and I enjoy collaborating with others too. ",

You will also find instructions on how to change the length as you like.*\r\n\r\n\r\n**Sizes**\r\nXS, (S), M, (L), XL, (2XL) to fit a bust circumference of: [80 – 85; (85 – 90); 90 – 95; (95 – 100); 100 – 110; (110 – 120) cm]; [31 ½ - 33 ½; (33½ - 35½); 35½ - 37½; (37½ - 39½); 39½ - 43¼; (43¼ - 47¼) inches].\r\n\r\n \r\n**Finished measurements** (wet blocked) \r\nCircumference: 98, (103), 108, (116), 126, (131) cm.\r\nLength (in the mid back neck excluded): 45, (45), 48, (48), 51, (51) cm. \r\n\r\nDesigned with 16 - 18 cm of positive ease. \r\n\r\nPlease note that measurements may vary based on changes you can make in the pattern. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Gauge**\r\n10 x 10 cm = 16 sts x 8 rows with 4.5 mm hook wet blocked in stitch pattern.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Materials**\r\nHook: 4.5 mm, or sizes needed to obtain gauge.\r\n\r\nNotions: Scissors, removable stitch markers, a measuring tape and a tapestry needle.\r\n \r\n\r\n**Yarn**\r\n6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10 balls of any DK-weight cotton/cotton blend yarn or any other yarn that allows you to obtain the correct gauge. \r\n\r\nFor my pink sweater in size M, 8 balls of Mon Amour microfiber yarn by Miss Tricot Filati are used (50 g/ 135 m). \r\n\r\nOther yarn options: Peo 30 by Silke or Cotton Merino by Drops Design can work as well. \r\nPlease note that the amount of yarn is an estimate and will vary if you choose a different length than the one indicated.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWRITTEN IN US CROCHET TERMINOLOGY\r\n\r\nHappy Crafting!\r\n\r\n**-------------------------------------------------------------------**\r\n\r\n\r\nITALIANO \r\n\r\nIl maglione Thea viene lavorato dal basso verso l’alto. Si inizia con il dietro, proseguendo poi con il davanti. Le maniche vengono lavorate dall'alto verso il basso in righe partendo dal giromanica e proseguendo fino al polsino. I polsini ed il bordo del collo sono rifiniti all'uncinetto con un punto a coste 1/1. \r\n\r\n\r\n*In questo pattern troverai istruzioni dettagliate e numerosi video tutorial che ti guideranno in tutti i passaggi più importanti, dall’inizio alla fine del lavoro. Troverai inoltre istruzioni come modificare la lunghezza a tuo piacimento.* \r\n\r\n\r\n **Livello di difficoltà:** Principiante \r\n\r\n\r\n**Taglie**\r\nXS, (S), M, (L), XL, (2XL)\r\nLe misure [XS, (S), M, (L), XL, (2XL)] vestono una circonferenza busto di: 80 – 85; (85 – 90); 90 – 95; (95 – 100); 100 – 110; (110 – 120) cm.\r\n\r\nIl maglione Thea è progettato per avere un agio positivo di circa 16 – 18 cm, il che significa che misurerà circa 16 – 18 cm in più della tua circonferenza busto.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Misure del capo finito** (dopo il lavaggio e il bloccaggio)\r\nCirconferenza: 98, (103), 108, (116), 126, (131) cm.\r\nLunghezza: 45, (45), 48, (48), 51, (51) cm. \r\n\r\nViene indicata la lunghezza del maglione rosa, il maglione bianco è lavorato con un misto lana in una versione leggermente più corta.\r\n\r\nSi prega di notare che le misure possono variare in base alle modifiche apportate nel pattern. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Campione**\r\n10 x 10 cm = 16 m x 8 righe con uncinetto 4.5 mm in pattern. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Materiali**\r\nUncinetto: 4.5 mm, oppure il numero che ti permette di ottenere il campione indicato.\r\nAvrai bisogno di alcuni marcapunti, forbici, metro e un ago da maglia.\r\n\r\n**Filato** \r\n6, (7), 8, (9), 10, (10) gomitoli di cotone, misto-cotone, lana, oppure qualsiasi altro filato dello spessore DK. \r\nPer il mio maglione rosa in taglia M ho usato 8 gomitoli di microfibra Mon Amour di Miss Tricot Filati (50 g/135 m). \r\n\r\n\r\nSi prega di notare che la quantità del filato potrebbe variare in base alla lunghezza del tuo maglione. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBuon Lavoro!",

I'm a stay at home mom of 3, a wife, gaming nerd, book lover, tattoo enthusiast, coffee drinker, crochet and knit loving gal. \r\nMy favorite part of crocheting and knitting is definitely designing and bringing those ideas to life. \r\n\r\nI love it even more when other's get to re-create my work. It makes me so happy seeing all the beautiful things my fellow makers create and it gives me the drive to continue designing unique, one of a kind patterns.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have been designing for a couple of years I am still learning new techniques to improve my pattern writing, layouts and product photography. I write my patterns with beginners in mind so it’s important to me that my patterns are not only size inclusive, but also ability inclusive. I have received wonderful feedback from crocheters and knitters alike about how easy it is to understand my patterns. That makes me really happy! If you have a question about one of my patterns, please do not hesitate to reach out for help.\r\n\r\n\r\nI love Instagram and seeing your progress and your projects, so feel free to connect with me (heartfullystitched) so I can see your makes! I can’t explain how gratifying it is to see yall enjoying an item made from one of my patterns. It’s my absolute favorite part of my work. I hope you find as much joy and happiness from them as I do! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It makes me so happy seeing all the beautiful things my fellow makers create and it gives me the drive to continue designing unique, one of a kind patterns.</p>\n\n<p>Although I have been designing for a couple of years I am still learning new techniques to improve my pattern writing, layouts and product photography. I write my patterns with beginners in mind so it’s important to me that my patterns are not only size inclusive, but also ability inclusive. I have received wonderful feedback from crocheters and knitters alike about how easy it is to understand my patterns. That makes me really happy! If you have a question about one of my patterns, please do not hesitate to reach out for help.</p>\n\n<p>I love Instagram and seeing your progress and your projects, so feel free to connect with me (heartfullystitched) so I can see your makes! I can’t explain how gratifying it is to see yall enjoying an item made from one of my patterns. It’s my absolute favorite part of my work. I hope you find as much joy and happiness from them as I do!</p>\n",

After finding out that we were expecting a little girl during my first pregnancy, I was gifted a beautiful, handmade crochet blanket from my mother-in-law. I fell in love with it and couldn't stop admiring the stitch work. So my mom bought me my first set of hooks, a few skeins of yarn and I haven't been able to put them down since, which is now going on 5 years. After following nothing but patterns for the first couple of years, I really wanted to venture off and design my own items, especially clothing. I love the beautiful, modern take on such an old craft and it feeds my creativity each time I come up with something new. I hope my designs inspire and bring joy to others. \r\n",

The fit is slightly oversized, but the wide rib edges and the shorter length give the sweater a feminine silhouette. The No Frills Sweater is worked from the top down, which makes it easy to try it on along the way, so you can customize it to fit your body and end up with the perfect sleeve and body length for you. If you want to make sure that the rib neck edge keeps it shape over time, you can sew a thin elastic thread along the edge. <br />Start by knitting a swatch to determine which needle size gives you the correct gauge.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size guide</strong> <br />The No Frills Sweater is designed to have approx. 15 cm [6 inches] of positive ease, meaning it is designed to be 15 cm [6 inches] larger in circumference than your chest measurement.

For example, if you measure 93 cm [36½ inches] around your bust (or around the widest part on your upper body) you should knit a size M.

After this, stitches are picked up and knitted for each shoulder, which are then joined to form the front yoke. The front and back yoke are joined to form the body, which is worked straight down in the round. The sleeves are worked in the round on double-pointed needles or on a circular needle using the Magic Loop technique. Finally, stitches are picked up at the neckline to work a ribbed edge, which is then folded over towards the inside to form a double neckband, which is closed by knitting the stitches together with the pick-up edge.</p>\n\n<p>Knit a swatch to determine which needle size you need to achieve the correct gauge – note that this can vary from yarn to yarn.

A size S sweater has a bust circumference of 112 cm [44 inches], which in the given example would give you 22 cm [8½ inches] of positive ease.\r\n\r\n**Sizes:** \r\nXS (S) M (L) XL (2XL) 3XL (4XL) 5XL\r\n\r\n**Bust circumference:** \r\n104 (112) 116 (120) 128 (136) 152 (160) 168 cm \r\n\\[41 (44) 45¾ (47¼) 50½ (53½) 63 (66¼) inches\\]\r\n\r\n**Length:** \r\n56 (58) 60 (63) 65 (67) 68 (69) 70 cm \r\n\\[22 (22¾) 23½ (24¾) 25½ (26½) 26¾ (27¼) 27½ inches\\]\r\n\r\n**Gauge:** \r\n20 sts x 30 rows = 10 x 10 cm \\[4 x 4 inches\\] in texture pattern on 4 mm [US6] needles after wash and blocking\r\n\r\n**Needles:** \r\n**Circular needles:** 4 mm \\[US6\\] / 40, 60, 80 and/or 100 cm [16, 24, 32 and/or 40 inches], 3 mm \\[US42½\\] / 40 cm \\[16 inches\\] and 3.5 mm \\[US4\\] / 40, 80 and/or 100 cm \\[16, 32 and/or 40 inches\\]\r\n\r\n**Double-pointed needles:** 4 mm \\[US6\\] and 3,5 mm \\[US4\\]\r\n\r\n**Materials:** \r\n400-450 (450) 450-500 (500-550) 550 (600) 650 (700) 750 g Jensen by Isager Yarn (50 g = 125 m \\[137 yds\\]) or 300-350 (350) 350-400 (400-450) 450 (450) 500 (500-550) 550 g Pernilla by Filcolana (50 g = 175 m \\[191 yds\\] or 500 (550) 600 (600-650) 650-700 (700-750) 800 (850-900) 900 g Double Sunday by Sandnes Garn (50 g = 108 m \\[118 yds\\]) held together with 125-150 (125-150) 150 (150-175) 175 (200) 200 (200-225) 225 g Silk Mohair by Isager Yarn (25 g = 212 m \\[232 yds\\]) or Soft Silk Mohair by Knitting for Olive (25 g = 225 m \\[246 yds\\]) or Brushed Lace by Mohair by Canard (25 g = 210 m \\[232 yds\\])\r\n\r\n**Difficulty:** ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ (5 out of 5)\r\n\r\nSee the classification of difficulty [here.][1]\r\n\r\nThe beige Ingrid Sweater is knitted in Jensen by Isager in the color 6 together with Silk Mohair by Isager in the color 6.\r\n\r\nThe grey Ingrid Sweater is knitted in Pelsuld 5,5/2 by Hjelholts Uldspinderi in the color Grå \\[01\\] held together with Silk Mohair by Isager in color 3S.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.petiteknit.com/en/pages/svaerhedsgrad",

The body is worked in the round on a circular needle, and the sleeves are worked in the round on double-pointed needles or on a circular needle using the Magic Loop technique.

    "notes_html": "\n<p>The Celeste Sweater is worked from the top down and has a circular yoke. First the neck edge is worked, then the yoke is worked in the round in the charted colorwork pattern using 5 different colors. Short rows are worked after the stranded pattern has been completed to raise the back and create a nice fit. The body and sleeves are worked in the round in stockinette stitch and finished with a rib edge.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that stranded knitting often needs to be worked on a needle 0.5-1 mm larger to maintain the same gauge as the stockinette stitch sections worked in one color. For this reason, you need to work a swatch in both the stranded colorwork pattern and in solid stockinette stitch before starting your sweater.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size guide</strong> <br />The Celeste Sweater is designed to have approx. 15 cm [6 inches] of positive ease, meaning it is designed to be approx. 15 cm [6 inches] larger in circumference than your bust measurement. The sizes XXS (XS) S (M) L (XL) 2XL (3XL) 4XL (5XL) are designed to fit a bust circumference of 75-80 (80-85) 85-90 (90-95) 95-100 (100-110) 110-120 (120-130) 130-140 (140-150) cm [29½-31½ (31½-33½) 33½-35½ (35½-37½) 37½-39½ (39½-43¼) 43¼-47¼ (47¼-51¼) 51¼-55 (55-59) inches].</p>\n\n<p>The measurements for the finished sweater are listed on the front page of the pattern. Begin by measuring yourself before starting your project, to determine which size will fit you the best. For example, if you measure 85 cm [33½ inches] around your bust (or around the widest part of your upper body) you should knit a size XS. A size XS sweater has a bust circumference of 100 cm [39¼ inches] which in the given example would give you 15 cm [6 inches] of positive ease.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sizes:</strong> <br />XXS (XS) S (M) L (XL) 2XL (3XL) 4XL (5XL)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bust circumference:</strong> <br />96 (100) 107 (111) 115 (123) 134 (142) 152 (160) cm <br />[37¾ (39¼) 42¼ (43¾) 45¼ (48½) 52¾ (56) 59¾ (63) inches]</p>\n\n<p><strong>Length:</strong> <br />56 (57) 58 (60) 63 (64) 66 (68) 70 (72) cm <br />[22 (22½) 22¾ (23½) 24¾ (25¼) 26 (26¾) 27½ (28¼) inches] (measured mid back excl. neck edge)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gauge:</strong> <br />20 sts x 30 rows = 10 x 10 cm [4 x 4 inches] in stockinette stitch on a 4 mm [US6] needle</p>\n\n<p>20 sts x 20-22 rows = 10 x 10 [4 x 4 inches] in colorwork pattern on a 4.5 mm [US7] needle</p>\n\n<p><strong>Needles:</strong> <br /><strong>Circular needles:</strong> 4.5 mm [US7] and 4 mm [US6] / 60, 80 and/or 100 cm [24, 32 and/or 40 inches], 3.5 mm [US4] / 80 or 100 cm [32 or 40 inches] and 3 mm [US2½] / 40 cm [16 inches] <br /><strong>Double-pointed needles:</strong> 4 mm [US6] and 3.5 mm [US4] (unless the Magic Loop technique is used); Optionally: A larger needle size for knitting the colorwork pattern</p>\n\n<p><strong>Materials:</strong> <br /><strong>Main color:</strong> 450 (450) 500 (550) 600 (650) 700 (700) 700-750 (750) g Peer Gynt by Sandnes Garn (50 g = 91 m [98 yds])</p>\n\n<p><strong>Contrast color:</strong> <br />50 g Peer Gynt by Sandnes Garn (50 g = 91 m [98 yds]) of each of the 4 colors (excl. swatch)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ (5 out of 5)</p>\n\n<p>See the classification of <a href=\"https://www.petiteknit.com/en/pages/svaerhedsgrad\">difficulty here.</a></p>\n\n<p>You can try combining different colors by filling in the chart that can be <a href=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1508/6772/files/xPaint_your_Celeste_Sweater_ENG.pdf?v=1697179464\">downloaded here.</a></p>\n\n<p>The white Celeste Sweater is knitted in Peer Gynt by Sandnes Garn in the colors Muskat melange [3070], Charcoal melange [1065], Mellombrun melert [2652], Shell melange [2710] and Almond [2511].</p>\n\n<p>The brown Celeste Sweater is knitted in Peer Gynt by Sandnes Garn in the colors Cacao nibs [3091], Shell melange [2710], Muskat melange [3070], Perfect purple [5012] and Night sky [5591].</p>\n",
    "notes": "The Celeste Sweater is worked from the top down and has a circular yoke. First the neck edge is worked, then the yoke is worked in the round in the charted colorwork pattern using 5 different colors. Short rows are worked after the stranded pattern has been completed to raise the back and create a nice fit. The body and sleeves are worked in the round in stockinette stitch and finished with a rib edge.\r\n\r\nPlease note that stranded knitting often needs to be worked on a needle 0.5-1 mm larger to maintain the same gauge as the stockinette stitch sections worked in one color. For this reason, you need to work a swatch in both the stranded colorwork pattern and in solid stockinette stitch before starting your sweater. \r\n\r\n**Size guide**\r\nThe Celeste Sweater is designed to have approx. 15 cm \\[6 inches\\] of positive ease, meaning it is designed to be approx. 15 cm \\[6 inches\\] larger in circumference than your bust measurement. The sizes XXS (XS) S (M) L (XL) 2XL (3XL) 4XL (5XL) are designed to fit a bust circumference of 75-80 (80-85) 85-90 (90-95) 95-100 (100-110) 110-120 (120-130) 130-140 (140-150) cm \\[29½-31½ (31½-33½) 33½-35½ (35½-37½) 37½-39½ (39½-43¼) 43¼-47¼ (47¼-51¼) 51¼-55 (55-59) inches\\]. \r\n\r\nThe measurements for the finished sweater are listed on the front page of the pattern.

A size L sweater has a bust circumference of 127 cm [50 inches\\] which in the given example would give you 24 cm \\[9½ inches\\] of positive ease.\r\n\r\n**Sizes:** \r\nXS (S) M (L) XL (2XL) 3XL (4XL)\r\n\r\n**Bust circumference:** \r\n111 (117) 121 (127) 133 (139) 145 (153) cm \r\n\\[43¾ (46) 47¾ (50) 52½ (54¾) 57 (60¼) inches\\]\r\n\r\n**Length:** \r\n67 (67) 69 (70) 70 (72) 75 (76) cm \r\n\\[26½ (26½) 27¼ (27½) 27½ (28¼) 29½ (30) inches\\] (measured mid back excl. collar)\r\n\r\n**Gauge:** \r\n20 sts x 28 rows = 10 x 10 cm \\[4 x 4 inches\\] in stockinette stitch on 4 mm \\[US6\\] needles after wash and blocking\r\n\r\n**Needles:** \r\n**Circular needles:** 3 mm \\[US2½\\] / 80 cm \\[32 inches\\], 3.5 mm \\[US4\\] / 80 cm \\[32 inches\\] and 4 mm \\[US6\\] / 40, 80 and/or 100 cm \\[16, 32 and/or 40 inches\\]. \r\n**Double-pointed needles:** 4 mm \\[US6\\] and 3.5 mm \\[US4\\] (unless the Magic Loop technique is used) \r\n\r\n**Materials:** \r\n750 (800) 850 (900) 950 (1000) 1050 (1050) g Peer Gynt by Sandnes Garn (50 g = 91 m \\[98 yds\\]). 6 mm zipper, 35 cm \\[13¾ inches\\].\r\n\r\n**Difficulty:** ★ ★ ★ ★ (4 out of 5)\r\n\r\nSee the classification of [difficulty here.][1] \r\n\r\nThe grey Zipper Sweater Light - Man is knitted in Peer Gynt by Sandnes Garn in the color Koksmelert \\[1088\\].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://petiteknit.myshopify.com/pages/degree-of-difficulty",

I am a classically trained flutist and now work as a freelance musician and knitwear designer. I enjoy playing the flute, have hobbies that come and go, love coffee, and hate jogging.\r\n\r\nDuring lockdown in the spring of 2020, there was a lot of time spent indoors, providing more time and space to reflect, practice flute, and knit. I started designing knitwear and published my first pattern in June 2020.\r\n\r\nSince then, several more patterns have followed, and the warm reception my designs have received truly means a lot to me. I hope I can contribute to enjoyable knitting moments and inspire a love for knitting.\r\n\r\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/novemberknits\r\nWebsite: www.novemberknits.com",

The sleeves are worked in the round on double-pointed needles or on a circular needle using the Magic Loop technique.

    "notes_html": "\n<p>The Frankie Blouse is worked from the top down with raglan increases on the yoke. Short rows are worked along the back of the neck to shape the neckline. The sleeves are worked in the round on double-pointed needles or on a circular needle. The Frankie Blouse is worked with narrow stripes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size guide</strong> <br />The Frankie Blouse is designed to have approx. 0-5 cm [0-2 inches] of positive ease, meaning it is designed to be approx. 0-5 cm [0-2 inches] larger in circumference than your bust measurement. The sizes XXS (XS) S (M) L (XL) 2XL (3XL) 4XL (5XL) are designed to fit a bust circumference of 75-80 (80-85) 85-90 (90-95) 95 100 (100-110) 110-120 (120-130) 130-140 (140-150) cm [29½-31½ (31½-33½) 33½-35½ (35½-37½) 37½-39½ (39½-43¼) 43¼-47¼ (47¼-51¼) 51¼-55 (55-59) inches]. The measurements for the finished blouse can be found on the front page of the pattern (please note that these measurements only apply if the correct gauge is maintained throughout).

    "notes_html": "\n<p><strong>About:</strong> The Sardine Sweater is an intermediate, top-down, circular-yoke, colorwork pattern. Knit in a blend of cotton and wool, this t-shirt style sweater is perfect for the spring and summer and the ultimate companion to wear while sipping from one of my handmade sardine mugs! This design features a relaxed fit, a cropped or full length hem, optional additional bust shaping, and suggestions for long sleeve modifications, allowing you to customize it to your liking.</p>\n\n<p>Whether you’re reveling in the sunshine at an outdoor cafe in Lisbon, living out the fish girl summer of your dreams at a secluded trout stream in New England, or simply trying to romanticize your midweek trip to the grocery store by putting on a fun outfit, the Sardine Sweater is the the ultimate wardrobe staple you didn’t know you were missing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Suggested Fiber:</strong> Portuguese fiber was an obvious choice for this pattern. Retrosaria is based in Lisbon, and is home to a wide variety of unique and thoughtful produced yarns. “Mungo” is a blend of wool and cotton, making it perfect for summer temperatures. Mungo has a slightly rustic feel at first, and softens with blocking and wear. It is made entirely from pre-consumer waste generated by Portuguese spinning mills.

    "notes": "**About:** The Sardine Sweater is an intermediate, top-down, circular-yoke, colorwork pattern.  Knit in a blend of cotton and wool, this t-shirt style sweater is perfect for the spring and summer and the ultimate companion to wear while sipping from one of my handmade sardine mugs! This design features a relaxed fit, a cropped or full length hem, optional additional bust shaping, and suggestions for long sleeve modifications, allowing you to customize it to your liking. \r\n\r\nWhether you’re reveling in the sunshine at an outdoor cafe in Lisbon, living out the fish girl summer of your dreams at a secluded trout stream in New England, or simply trying to romanticize your midweek trip to the grocery store by putting on a fun outfit, the Sardine Sweater is the the ultimate wardrobe staple you didn’t know you were missing. \r\n\r\n**Suggested Fiber:** Portuguese fiber was an obvious choice for this pattern. Retrosaria is based in Lisbon, and is home to a wide variety of unique and thoughtful produced yarns. \"Mungo\" is a blend of wool and cotton, making it perfect for summer temperatures. Mungo has a slightly rustic feel at first, and softens with blocking and wear. It is made entirely from pre-consumer waste generated by Portuguese spinning mills. For a long sleeve, colder weather version, Retrosaria Rosa Pomar’s “Beroia” is a gorgeous option. Beroia is a worsted weight, 100% Portuguese wool spun from free grazing Bordaleira Serra da Estrela sheep.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Sizing:** 2-6 inches / 5-15 cm of positive ease, meaning you should pick a finished chest circumference size that is 2-6 inches / 5-15 cm larger than your chest measurement.

The neckline is opened up for a feminine touch. The shape of the sweater is slightly asymmetrical with extra length added to the back. The sweater is worked from the top down with no additional finishing required.</p>\n\n<p>SIZES</p>\n\n<p>XS (S) M (L) XL (2XL) 3XL (4XL)</p>\n\n<p>MEASUREMENTS</p>\n\n<p>Length (measured at the center front below the neck rib): 46 (48) 50 (52) 56 (60) 63 (65) cm <span>18 (19) 19.75 (20.5) 22 (23.5) 24.75 (25.5) inches</span></p>\n\n<p>Circumference: 116 (123) 128 (132) 136 (141) 148 (157) cm <span>45.75 (48.5) 50.5 (52) 53.5 (55.5) 58.25 (61.75) inches</span></p>\n\n<p>Size guide</p>\n\n<p>Sweater No. 24 has an oversize fit. The smaller sizes have a greater positive ease than the larger sizes in order to complement the individual body the best.

Add 3 or more to your cart and get 20% off—no code needed.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Soft Current Sweater is a DK weight sweater with a little bit of everything we love: clean finishings, purposeful shaping, and knitting that stays engaging. The lace and cable panels sweep over the shoulders and continue down the front and back, with short rows shaping that gives the V neckline its signature smooth, flattering line.</p>\n\n<p>At this gauge, the texture is bold and clear, with a fabric that drapes beautifully and wears effortlessly. If you’ve already knit our <a href=\"https://ravel.me/soft-current-tee\">Soft Current Tee</a>, think of this as its sweater sister, same flowing motif, now with long sleeves and a closer fit. The idea started with our original wrap <a href=\"/patterns/library/soft-current\">Soft Current</a> and we love seeing how it translates across the whole series.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"design_details\"><strong>Design Details</strong></h3>\n\n<p>This seamless top down sweater begins at the shoulders with short row shaping to form the V neckline. The lace and cable panels are integrated into both the front and back and flow cleanly from the shoulder join into the body.</p>\n\n<p>We’ve scaled the lace motif on the back to maintain visual balance across all sizes, so it looks cohesive and well proportioned no matter which size you make. See <a href=\"/patterns/library/soft-current-tee\">Soft Current Tee</a> for more examples.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"what_we_love_about_the_yarn\"><strong>What We Love About the Yarn</strong></h3>\n\n<p>We knit our sample in <strong>Comfort DK (Comfort Sport)</strong> by <strong>Midknit Cravings</strong> in <strong>Green Gables</strong>, and it checked every box for this design.

    "notes": ">  **Bundle and Save with [Wool &\r\n> Pine](https://www.ravelry.com/designers/wool--pine)\r\n> Patterns! Add 3 or more to your cart\r\n> and get 20% off—no code needed.**\r\n\r\n Soft Current Sweater is a DK weight sweater with a little bit of everything we love: clean finishings, purposeful shaping, and knitting that stays engaging. The lace and cable panels sweep over the shoulders and continue down the front and back, with short rows shaping that gives the V neckline its signature smooth, flattering line.\r\n\r\nAt this gauge, the texture is bold and clear, with a fabric that drapes beautifully and wears effortlessly. If you’ve already knit our [Soft Current Tee](https://ravel.me/soft-current-tee), think of this as its sweater sister, same flowing motif, now with long sleeves and a closer fit. The idea started with our original wrap [Soft Current](/patterns/library/soft-current) and we love seeing how it translates across the whole series.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Design Details**\r\n\r\nThis seamless top down sweater begins at the shoulders with short row shaping to form the V neckline. The lace and cable panels are integrated into both the front and back and flow cleanly from the shoulder join into the body.\r\n\r\nWe’ve scaled the lace motif on the back to maintain visual balance across all sizes, so it looks cohesive and well proportioned no matter which size you make. See [Soft Current Tee](/patterns/library/soft-current-tee) for more examples.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **What We Love About the Yarn**\r\n\r\nWe knit our sample in **Comfort DK (Comfort Sport)** by **Midknit Cravings** in **Green Gables**, and it checked every box for this design. It’s soft against the skin, drapes beautifully, and has the kind of stitch definition that makes every cable pop and every lace eyelet look crisp.\r\n\r\nWe also love the saturated tonal depth, it adds richness to the fabric without distracting from the texture.\r\n\r\nColorway: Green Gables  \r\nFiber: 85% superwash merino / 15% nylon  \r\nYardage: 246 yds (225 m) per 100g skein\r\n\r\nAny DK weight yarn with good stitch definition will work. For USA customers, we recommend using your favorite tonal DK yarn. Check out our testers’ projects for lots of beautiful options and inspiration.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Why You'll Love It**\r\n\r\n- **Seamless, top down construction** for a smooth knitting experience  \r\n- **V neckline and shoulder shaping** for a flattering fit  \r\n- **Lace and cable textures** keep your needles entertained\r\n- **DK weight fabric and long sleeves** easy to wear, easy to style  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Construction Overview**\r\n\r\nSoft Current Sweater is worked seamlessly from the top down. The sweater begins with the right and left shoulders, which are worked flat with short row shaping to shape the V neckline. These are then joined at the front and worked flat to the underarm.\r\n\r\nStitches for the back shoulders are picked up from the provisional cast on and also worked flat with short row shaping. The left and right back sections are joined and worked to the underarm.\r\n\r\nAt the underarm, the front and back are joined to work the body in the round. The body is knit to the desired length and finished with 1x1 ribbing. No seaming is required, though optional seaming can be used to adjust the armhole fit after blocking, before sleeves are picked up and worked in the round.\r\n\r\nThe lace panel is integrated into the front and back. The back panel is scaled to maintain visual balance across all sizes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Needles & Gauge**\r\n\r\n- US 4 (3.50 mm) 16–40\" circular needle  \r\n- US 6 (4.00 mm) 16–40\" circular needle  \r\n\r\n20 sts x 30 rows = 4 x 4\" in stockinette on US 6  \r\n(measured flat and in the round, wet blocked and pinned)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Yardage Requirements**\r\n\r\n960 (1080, 1180, 1320, 1440, 1560)(1680, 1810, 1940, 2070, 2200) yds  \r\n\r\n878 (988, 1080, 1208, 1318, 1426)(1536, 1655, 1774, 1894, 2011)m\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Finished Measurements**\r\n\r\nSoft Current Sweater is designed for **4–8\" (10–20 cm) of positive ease** at the bust.\r\n\r\nTo choose your size:\r\n1. Measure your full bust.\r\n2. Add **4–8\"**.\r\n3. Choose the pattern size that matches that number.\r\n\r\nExample: If your bust is **40\"**, choose:\r\n- **44\"** for a closer fit through the shoulders and sleeves  \r\n- **48\"** for a roomier fit through the upper arm and shoulder  \r\n\r\nIf your bust is **47\" or larger**, we suggest **4–6\"** of positive ease.\r\n\r\nNeed sizing help?

    "notes_html": "\n<p>Calgary Bay Sweater is a cosy oversized sweater, worked from <br />the top down in Reverse Half Fisherman’s rib stitch.</p>\n\n<p>First the back is worked back and forth with increases either <br />side. Stitches are then picked up along the back yoke to form <br />each front whilst shaping the neck and subsequently the <br />underarms. The fronts are then joined with the back and <br />worked back and forth and before joining to work in the <br />round at the bottom of the button band.

          "about_me": "Behind My Favourite Things you'll meet Louise. \r\nLouise has been working in the Danish fashion industry for more than a decade, and has been taking part in developing and growing well-known designer brands for years.  \r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning of MFTK, Louise's main focus has been to create classic and timeless wardrobe favourites of high quality, that lasts for more than a season: simple but aesthetically pleasing designs with thought out details, always aiming for 'the perfect fit'. \r\n\r\nLouise says; 'After more than a decade in the fashion industry, I experienced a saturation of overconsumption and mass production.
